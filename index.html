										<h2>My IT Profile</h2>
										<p>Personal Information</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hello. My name is James. I come from Australia and was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Roxburgh Park. I am eighteen years old and have an adorable dog named Millie. I have up till now, completed my education up to finishing Year Twelve in Roxburgh College during 2020. I am currently going through my first year at RMIT, I am enjoying it. I hope to find great success in my degree called <i>Bachelor of Information Technology</i>, as it will aid me in my occupational future.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I have always had an obsession with IT, even when I was a small kid learning to use computers for the first time. My passion for IT flourished as I progressed through high school; learning to type HTML code, designing some websites and going through Python language crash courses, these all motivated me to explore the possibilities of what my ideal job will be.</p>

<p>Choosing the degree I did for RMIT was the perfect choice since many experienced programmers and developers have made their start refining their abilities in RMIT's doors. Therefore, working through my three years at RMIT will allow me to refine all of my coding capabilities.</p>

<p>I expect to become an experienced developer coming out of this degree than I did coming in, I want to be able to learn all the ins and outs of computer coding, I want to be able to confidently create and run my own programs without fearing for a latent error, my time at RMIT will make all of this possible.</p>

									<h3>My Three test Results</h3>
									<p>The following are results taken from three personality tests. They are the Myers Briggs Type Inidcator tests, a learning preferences test, and a test to guage my level of creativity, below the results is a overall perception of them.</p>
									<div class="features">

												<h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
												<p>From going through an MBTI test, I was able to find out that my personality is reflective of The Entertainer (specifically ESFP-A).</p>
												<h4>Strengths</h4>
												<p>Entertainers are known for being able to step out of their comfort zones in full confidence, striving for originality, injecting artistic creativity into their words and actions, show great pleasure in being proactive, recognising the subtle changes around them, and portraying great people skills around strangers and those they love.</p>
												<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
												<p>On the other hand, entertainers are known for being very emotional, becoming vulnerable in the face of criticism, ignoring and avoiding conflict entirely only to find funner occasions, having a high tendency for boredom, having fragile long-term plans which show flaws, and generally being unfocused towards long-term dedications.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Learning Preferences</h3>
												<p>From going through this test, I was able to figure out that I am a <b>Visual</b> learner, they work best when provided with diagrams or other visual stimuli, they may also find pleasure in perceiving what they are learning in their mind. <b>Visual</b> learners have the biggest gripe with verbal directions and have a tendency to be distracted by short, ultimately meaningless sounds.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Creativity Test</h3>
												<p>From going through this test, I was able to figure out that my creativity is at a level that is a "work in progress", though it is very close to being one of my core strengths, I'd just have to adapt and present my creative ideas to more potential opportunities, my exact results are as follows:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Finding Problems (Preparation) =  2.4/5</li>
													<li>Gathering and Reflecting on Information (Incubation) = 4.5/5</li>
													<li>Problem Exploration (Insight) = 4.3/5</li>
													<li>Generating and Evaluating Ideas (Evaluation) = 2.7/5</li>
													<li>Implementation (Elaboration) = 4/5</li>
												</ul>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Summary of results</h4>
												<p>After going through these three tests, I believe that I have a fun personality which blends subtly into my work ethic. I am able to bring smiles to my peers and friends while also encouraging myself and others to go for higher goals, I am also easily approachable and will be able to fit into any team setting, my only drawbacks being that I hardly focus on the long-term and have an overall higher emotional sensitivity.</p>
												<p>My style of learning is visual, this allows me to flourish when perceiving information in my mind, or when visual stimuli are presented to me, with my biggest weakness being verbal directions and tepid sounds. My level of creativity shows that it is close to being one of my core strengths, short work on both my preparation and evaluation of day-to-day life would allow it to flourish as a key attribute of my character. Overall, these tests provide a highly accurate look into my structured personality.</p>
												<p>The result of these tests also provide insight into how I’d function in a work group, showing that I’d be an invaluable member to most styles of groups. Both my learning style and creativity benefit off of each other, allowing both my quality of work and my personality to grow together, therefore, I’d definitely be able to provide my team members with fun memories during each group session. Due to the nature of these results, I’ll be able to iron out any drawbacks that come from them in a group setting, while it would be difficult, it’ll allow my mental growth to blossom.<p>
												<p>These three tests’ outcomes will prompt me to accept and come to terms with the fact that team members can have either complementary or contrasting personalities. I’ll have to see past this being a problem and learn to evolve with team members, as their intellectual abilities should not be neglected because their personality does not pair well with mine. Unless their personality is far too abrasive, and prevents other members from being able to grow with them, or their learning style does not reflect the group’s, or they show no real aptitude to flourish creatively, potential candidates for a team will have an equal opportunity in my eyes.</p>

									<h3>ExactBot, the FAQ chatbot!</h3>
									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>ExactBot is an FAQ chatbot which can be adapted to more than a few contexts, it will reside in the discussion forums of many different styles of informative websites, anything from recipe sites, to car sites, and many more. Companies and other website developers will be able to download and apply ExactBot to their discussion forms or FAQ pages, making the application process easy. Developing the chatbot will take two to three years, and it will require complex coding for it to run effectively. Regardless, its benefit will aid several people browsing the internet, proving that the effort to program ExactBot is worth it.</p>
									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>The reason I hope to bring this project to light is due to its fortified utility. Across the internet, there are 4 billion users that find themselves confused over a certain topic or just would like some insight about a subject they are interested in. Using high-level Python code will be a tough yet effective solution to this issue. ExactBot will be the solution to many, if not all of your immediate questions about a website.</p>
									<h4>Description</h4>
									<p>Exactbot is able to help answer so many questions thanks to its vast vocabulary, and it’s succinct customizability with its phrases. The chatbot will be able to respond to so many different questions thanks to its machine learning which can make distinctions between separate types of queries which may have the same general theme. For example, say you were on a recipe website and were asking about flour, if you ask ExactBot “What type of flour should I use?”, it will find “flour”, “type”, and then the query of “What” and will be able to respond quickly with a predetermined answer that is assigned to the question. Now imagine you asked a second question of “How much flour should be used?”, it will see the “flour”, “much”, the query of “How”, make the distinction that the question is asking for an amount of flour, and respond with a pre-built answer. ExactBot is a downloadable program, meaning that its exact operations will function by a website developer, they would start by selecting a query, which could be “What”, “Where”, “When”, “How”, “Will”, etc., and then a word that contextualises the question, like “style”, “much”, “type” which are loosely connected to the query, and then an indicator, “flour”, “car”, “dog”, etc. which can essentially be anything thanks Exactbot’s ability to add any of these types of words, essentially customising the database to their liking.</p> 
									<p>The developer would then type an answer to the three chosen words, giving them the full reign to decide how ExactBot will respond to users’ questions. When looking through the dropdown menus for your needed word, you will be able to search for the word you’re looking for, whether it’s a query word, a word tied to the query, or an indicator. If you cannot find the words you are looking for, you can always add your own to the database (which will remain private since you are applying it to your website) or wait for a subsequent update to ExactBot. Future updates to ExactBot will eventually remove the need for the website developer to type out the answer, and will apply machine learning to autofill a response which could then be refined by the developer, think of it as a less aggressive form of autocorrect software.</p>
									<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
									<p>For ExactBot to work effectively, it will need high-level Python coding for the best results. Opening up the program will bring you to an initial page where you type in the URL for your discussion forum, you will then be greeted to the page where you can customise and answer questions (as shown in Description), then you will have total freedom at that point. ExactBot is powered by the open source tool of PandoraBots, the largest and most experienced chatbot hosting service on the interne</p>
									<h4>Skills Required</h4>
									<p>So ExactBot runs smoothly, I will need to:
										<ul>
<li>refine my skills in Python code, which would</li>
<li>enhance my skills with programs, allowing for more complex functions to occur,</li>
<li>clarify my ability to code query boxes with dropdown menus,</li>
<li>learn how to create executable programs that can publicly be downloaded via a GitHub repository,</li>
<li>revise potential words which could be used in ExactBot, and</li>
<li>understand how potential clients of the chatbot will operate it.</li>
