										<h2>My IT Profile</h2>
										<p>Personal Information</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hello. My name is James. I come from Australia and was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Roxburgh Park. I am eighteen years old and have an adorable dog named Millie. I have up till now, completed my education up to finishing Year Twelve in Roxburgh College during 2020. I am currently going through my first year at RMIT, I am enjoying it. I hope to find great success in my degree called <i>Bachelor of Information Technology</i>, as it will aid me in my occupational future.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I have always had an obsession with IT, even when I was a small kid learning to use computers for the first time. My passion for IT flourished as I progressed through high school; learning to type HTML code, designing some websites and going through Python language crash courses, these all motivated me to explore the possibilities of what my ideal job will be.</p>

<p>Choosing the degree I did for RMIT was the perfect choice since many experienced programmers and developers have made their start refining their abilities in RMIT's doors. Therefore, working through my three years at RMIT will allow me to refine all of my coding capabilities.</p>

<p>I expect to become an experienced developer coming out of this degree than I did coming in, I want to be able to learn all the ins and outs of computer coding, I want to be able to confidently create and run my own programs without fearing for a latent error, my time at RMIT will make all of this possible.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These people work in teams to plan, design, and produce video games for different platforms such as computers, mobile devices, and gaming consoles. Their work typically involves creating the project ideas for the game as well as writing high-quality code to implement all of the game's features and functionality.</p>

<h4>Skills I have</h4>
<p>An understanding of Python script, a vast ability with creative works, including drawing background elements, character design, and world building. Another skill I have is an excellent drive for teamwork and organisation.</p>

<h4>Skills I need</h4>
<p>A deeper understanding of scripts including Python and many programming languages, an ability to perform effectively under a timed setting, a finer sense for catching latent errors in coding, and a greater sense in understanding the correct context in which questions are asked.</p>

<h4>Learning Plan</h4>
<p>I will use my time in RMIT to gain all of the necessary skills required for my future endeavour into becoming a Senior Game Developer, as well as obtaining new skills which will help drive my motivation towards the future.</p>

									<h3>Here are my key skills!</h3>
									<p>The following are a set of key skills I have, these allow me to flourish in most IT work environments.</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="icon solid fa-code">Thorough knowledge of programming</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-users">Drive for Teamwork</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-cubes">Resourcefulness</li>

									<h3>My Three test Results</h3>
									<p>The following are results taken from three personality tests. They are the Myers Briggs Type Inidcator tests, a learning preferences test, and a test to guage my level of creativity, below the results is a overall perception of them.</p>

												<h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
												<p>From going through an MBTI test, I was able to find out that my personality is reflective of The Entertainer (specifically ESFP-A).</p>
												<h4>Strengths</h4>
												<p>Entertainers are known for being able to step out of their comfort zones in full confidence, striving for originality, injecting artistic creativity into their words and actions, show great pleasure in being proactive, recognising the subtle changes around them, and portraying great people skills around strangers and those they love.</p>
												<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
												<p>On the other hand, entertainers are known for being very emotional, becoming vulnerable in the face of criticism, ignoring and avoiding conflict entirely only to find funner occasions, having a high tendency for boredom, having fragile long-term plans which show flaws, and generally being unfocused towards long-term dedications.</p>
											</div>

										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Learning Preferences</h3>
												<p>From going through this test, I was able to figure out that I am a <b>Visual</b> learner, they work best when provided with diagrams or other visual stimuli, they may also find pleasure in perceiving what they are learning in their mind. <b>Visual</b> learners have the biggest gripe with verbal directions and have a tendency to be distracted by short, ultimately meaningless sounds.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Creativity Test</h3>
												<p>From going through this test, I was able to figure out that my creativity is at a level that is a "work in progress", though it is very close to being one of my core strengths, I'd just have to adapt and present my creative ideas to more potential opportunities, my exact results are as follows:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Finding Problems (Preparation) =  2.4/5</li>
													<li>Gathering and Reflecting on Information (Incubation) = 4.5/5</li>
													<li>Problem Exploration (Insight) = 4.3/5</li>
													<li>Generating and Evaluating Ideas (Evaluation) = 2.7/5</li>
													<li>Implementation (Elaboration) = 4/5</li>
												</ul>
											</div>

												<h4>Summary of results</h4>
												<p>After going through these three tests, I believe that I have a fun personality which blends subtly into my work ethic. I am able to bring smiles to my peers and friends while also encouraging myself and others to go for higher goals, I am also easily approachable and will be able to fit into any team setting, my only drawbacks being that I hardly focus on the long-term and have an overall higher emotional sensitivity.</p>
												<p>My style of learning is visual, this allows me to flourish when perceiving information in my mind, or when visual stimuli are presented to me, with my biggest weakness being verbal directions and tepid sounds. My level of creativity shows that it is close to being one of my core strengths, short work on both my preparation and evaluation of day-to-day life would allow it to flourish as a key attribute of my character. Overall, these tests provide a highly accurate look into my structured personality.</p>
												<p>The result of these tests also provide insight into how I’d function in a work group, showing that I’d be an invaluable member to most styles of groups. Both my learning style and creativity benefit off of each other, allowing both my quality of work and my personality to grow together, therefore, I’d definitely be able to provide my team members with fun memories during each group session. Due to the nature of these results, I’ll be able to iron out any drawbacks that come from them in a group setting, while it would be difficult, it’ll allow my mental growth to blossom.<p>
												<p>These three tests’ outcomes will prompt me to accept and come to terms with the fact that team members can have either complementary or contrasting personalities. I’ll have to see past this being a problem and learn to evolve with team members, as their intellectual abilities should not be neglected because their personality does not pair well with mine. Unless their personality is far too abrasive, and prevents other members from being able to grow with them, or their learning style does not reflect the group’s, or they show no real aptitude to flourish creatively, potential candidates for a team will have an equal opportunity in my eyes.</p>
