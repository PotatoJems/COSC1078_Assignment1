										<h2>My IT Profile</h2>
										<p>Personal Information</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hello. My name is James. I come from Australia and was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Roxburgh Park. I am eighteen years old and have an adorable dog named Millie. I have up till now, completed my education up to finishing Year Twelve in Roxburgh College during 2020. I am currently going through my first year at RMIT, I am enjoying it. I hope to find great success in my degree called <i>Bachelor of Information Technology</i>, as it will aid me in my occupational future.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I have always had an obsession with IT, even when I was a small kid learning to use computers for the first time. My passion for IT flourished as I progressed through high school; learning to type HTML code, designing some websites and going through Python language crash courses, these all motivated me to explore the possibilities of what my ideal job will be.</p>

<p>Choosing the degree I did for RMIT was the perfect choice since many experienced programmers and developers have made their start refining their abilities in RMIT's doors. Therefore, working through my three years at RMIT will allow me to refine all of my coding capabilities.</p>

<p>I expect to become an experienced developer coming out of this degree than I did coming in, I want to be able to learn all the ins and outs of computer coding, I want to be able to confidently create and run my own programs without fearing for a latent error, my time at RMIT will make all of this possible.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>These people work in teams to plan, design, and produce video games for different platforms such as computers, mobile devices, and gaming consoles. Their work typically involves creating the project ideas for the game as well as writing high-quality code to implement all of the game's features and functionality.</p>

<h4>Skills I have</h4>
<p>An understanding of Python script, a vast ability with creative works, including drawing background elements, character design, and world building. Another skill I have is an excellent drive for teamwork and organisation.</p>

<h4>Skills I need</h4>
<p>A deeper understanding of scripts including Python and many programming languages, an ability to perform effectively under a timed setting, a finer sense for catching latent errors in coding, and a greater sense in understanding the correct context in which questions are asked.</p>

<h4>Learning Plan</h4>
<p>I will use my time in RMIT to gain all of the necessary skills required for my future endeavour into becoming a Senior Game Developer, as well as obtaining new skills which will help drive my motivation towards the future.</p>
